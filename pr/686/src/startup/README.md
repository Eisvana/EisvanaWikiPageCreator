# startup

Dear reader, this folder is intended to only hold code that runs on startup.

This means NO EXPORTS!!! I don't want to see any exports here!

Similarly, code that runs on startup has no business outside of this folder! If
you act against this rule, the whole site will break!!!

ONLY PUT RUNNING CODE HERE, NO EXPORTS!!!

If you have something you want to define here and then get out, define an object
or array in the `variables` folder first, then attach whatever you want to
export to that object or array.
